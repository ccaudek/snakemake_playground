## A title

This is an R Markdown document.  Here I print the path that is currently used:

```{r}
getwd()
```

This script uses the data subset `r snakemake@input[["subset_data"]]` that has been extracted from `r snakemake@input[["data"]]`.

Let's make a summary of the data:

```{r}
d <- readRDS(snakemake@input[["subset_data"]])
summary(d)
```

Here I generate a plot from the input data:

```{r}
d %>%
    ggplot(
        aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g)
    ) +
    geom_point()
```

### Syntax note

Here I print a path passed through the snakefile object. Here it is:

`r snakemake@input[["table_data"]]`

Note the syntax used in the .smk rule: `rules.save_table.output.tab1`.

### Displaying the content of an external .txt file

I read the address of the file:

```{r}
foo <- snakemake@input[["table_data"]]
foo
```

The address in the object `foo` is enclosed in quotes. This is the argument of the function `readLines()`.  With the following syntax, I get the desired result. The chunk needs the specification `{r comment=''}`:

```{r comment=''}
cat(readLines(foo), sep = '\n')
```

## Include pdf image

### First method

The problem is that the pdf files of the figures are stored in the `results`,
directory, which is one level up from the working directory specifyed by
`here::here()`. The simplest solution is to pass the address of the image with
`snakemake@params`:

```{r first-method, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(snakemake@params[["pdf_fig1"]])
```

### Second method

If the file is in a subset folder from the working directory, it is possible to
use `here::here()`. In this example, the file is located in the same folder as
the rmd script being executed:

```{r, second-method, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("scripts", "reports", "figure_1.pdf"))
```
